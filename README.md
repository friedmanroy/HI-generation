# Conditional Glow for HI Map Generation
This repository contains the implementation of a conditional [Glow](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/research-covers/glow/paper/glow.pdf) (cGlow) used in order to model neutral hydrogen (HI) maps. While primarily focused on HI maps, the code in this repository can be used for any task where a cGlow model, conditioned on few parameters, is needed.
